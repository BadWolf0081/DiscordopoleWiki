# Getting Started

- Copy the config_example directory and rename it to config: `cp -r config_example config`
- Install requirements.txt: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt --upgrade`
- Fill in config/config.ini
- Set up geofences in geofence.json. It's the exact same format Poracle uses so you can just copy the file from there
- Run the bot with `python3 discordopole.py`
- Invite it to your server and give it Admin perms (TODO)

## Config options
